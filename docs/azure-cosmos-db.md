## Cosmos DB Resource Model

- Azure Cosmos container is the fundamental unit of scalability.
- You can virtually have an unlimited provisioned throughput (RU/s) and storage on a container.
- Azure Cosmos DB transparently partitions your container using the logical partition key that you specify in order to elastically scale your provisioned throughput and storage
